- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Samzysam
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Learning more about coding
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on *PixelPlay*

*A work in progress...*

I'm still learning and experimenting with web development, and this repository is a reflection of my journey. PixelPlay is a personal project where I'm exploring pixel art, retro styles, and web design.

*Current Status:*

- Still learning and building
- Not perfect, but improving slowly
- Open to feedback and suggestions!

*Features:*

- Pixelated retro style logo (still a work in progress)
- Basic HTML structure
- CSS styling (needs improvement)
- More features to come as I learn and grow!

*Goals:*

- Improve my web development skills
- Create a unique and engaging pixel art style
- Build a community of like-minded learners and developers

*Contributing:*

If you're a fellow learner or experienced developer, feel free to:

- Offer feedback and suggestions
- Contribute to the codebase (if you'd like)
- Share your own learning resources and tips!

*Thanks for stopping by!*

I hope you can help me grow and evolve.
